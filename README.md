# Node Bees

A humorous **blender addon** that adds **bees** to any node group

*Please do not use this addon on production files*

## Features

* Generated bees stay inside of the .blend file, so you can share a file full of bees to your friends
* Bees still fly without addon installed
* Renaming support
* Adjustable speed and amplitude
* Easily removable with one button click
* You can leash them together if you like
* Annoying
* Pointless (round)
* ngon-free

## Supported blender versions

* 3.5.1
* 3.6

The addon will likely work on other blender versions, perhaps as low as 2.8, but this was not tested.
